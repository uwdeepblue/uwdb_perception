# Datasets

Folder for storing datasets that are used for test and production purposes. Currently only contains a single image, but will be updated to include other datasets in the near future.

As best practice, store one-of images in the images folder, with a name indicative of its purpose (ie, nois_butterfly.png is being used to test denoising algorithms). Complete datasets should have their own folders and be documented and referenced in this readme file.
